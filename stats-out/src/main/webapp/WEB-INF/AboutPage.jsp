    <br><br><br>
        vc-diss is a new, distributed, cloud-based volunteer computing platform.
<br><br>
        Volunteer computing (VC) is a pattern employed by people with too much data to process, where the work is split up
        and distributed to volunteers, who "crunch" the work and reply with the results.
    <br><br>
        Lots of important work is currently being carried out using VC systems. For instance, <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/">Folding@Home</a>, which
        asks users to run simulations that could help advance cures for certain diseases.
    <br><br>
        But vc-diss is different. Using modern cloud technologies, our service is hosted more reliably, at a fraction of the cost.
    <br><br>
        We only support one algorithm at the moment, but with any support that will change.
    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
