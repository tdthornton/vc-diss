    <br><br><br>
        vc-diss is a new, distributed, cloud-based volunteer computing platform.
    <br><br>
        Such a platform faces a few unique restrictions, which is why we've compiled the terms and conditions
        <br> of use into this short document.

        <br>These terms define how we will act, and how you must act, when using the system.
    <br>In this early stage of the project, the terms are not finalised.
    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    vc-diss Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

    <br><br>1. Terms
<br><br>
    <br><br>By accessing the website at http://vc-diss.appspot.com, you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws.

<br><br>
    <br><br>2. Use License
<br><br>
    <br><br>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on vc-diss's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

    <br><br>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on vc-diss's website;
    <br><br>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
    <br><br>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.
    <br><br>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by vc-diss at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.
    <br><br>3. Disclaimer
